            <h2>Design Process & Iteration</h2>
            <p>
                As Lead Game Designer, my process for Chibi Clash involved taking broad client requests and translating them into actionable, detailed design specifications for the development team. This required a strong focus on clear documentation and continuous iteration.
            </p>
            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>1. Client Requirements to GDD</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon receiving initial client requests from Kuma Games, I was responsible for transforming these high-level ideas into comprehensive Game Design Documents[cite: 13]. This involved breaking down concepts into specific features, outlining mechanics, and detailing asset requirements for coding, UI/UX, visual effects, and sound effects[cite: 13].
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>2. Cross-Functional Collaboration & Fine-Tuning</h3>
                <p>
                    A key aspect of this project was close collaboration with various departments, including Developers, QAs, and Artists[cite: 14]. Through regular sync-ups and task management on ClickUp/Jira, I ensured that design intentions were accurately translated into the game and that all features met quality standards and client expectations[cite: 14].
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h3>3. Mentoring & Design Guideline Development</h3>
                <p>
                    As Lead Game Designer, I established and refined internal guidelines for creating all game design documents used by the studio[cite: 18]. This included interviewing and mentoring new designers, ensuring consistency and high quality across all design outputs[cite: 19].

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Challenge: Maintaining Client Alignment & Quality in Outsourcing</h3>
            <p>
                One of the primary challenges was ensuring seamless communication and adherence to client expectations for an international outsourcing project[cite: 12, 15]. Bridging the gap between the client's vision and the development team's execution, while maintaining high quality standards, was critical[cite: 14].
            </p>
            <h3>Solution: Proactive Communication & Detailed Documentation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented a strict communication protocol, providing regular progress updates and actively seeking client feedback to prevent misunderstandings[cite: 15].</li>
                <li>Utilized detailed GDDs and update plans to clearly define all assets and functionalities, leaving minimal room for ambiguity[cite: 13].</li>
                <li>Managed tasks meticulously on ClickUp/Jira, providing real-time visibility for both the internal team and the client on project progress and potential blockers[cite: 14].</li>
            </ul>
